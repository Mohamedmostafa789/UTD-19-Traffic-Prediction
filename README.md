UTD 19 Traffic Prediction 
This data science project focuses on predicting short-term traffic flow using the 
UTD19 dataset, which contains real-world traffic data from 40 cities. The dataset is 
derived from traffic detectors that record essential metrics such as flow, occupancy, 
and, in some cases, speed at regular intervals, often 5 minutes but sometimes varying. 
These metrics reflect the variability and complexity of traffic patterns across different 
urban areas. Readers can learn more about the dataset on its official page: UTD19 
Dataset Page. 
The primary goal of this project is to predict the next time step of traffic flow using 
the available historical data. By leveraging the temporal relationships and patterns in 
traffic flow, the model aims to provide accurate short-term forecasts. The predictive 
model for this project is yet to be developed and will rely on a data-driven approach to 
make real-time inferences about future traffic conditions. 
We plan to use a spatio-temporal attention model for the prediction task, which can 
effectively capture both spatial and temporal dependencies in the traffic data, once the 
model development phase begins. Additionally, we will establish baselines to evaluate 
the performance of our model, which will include simpler time-series prediction 
models such as SARIMA. Tasks like filling in missing data using techniques such as 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and experimenting with feature engineering ideas will 
be crucial to enhance model performance. Currently, the project is in the development 
stage, and we are in the process of gathering features from external data sources, 
which may include weather data, public events, and other contextual information that 
could influence traffic patterns. By comparing the spatio-temporal attention model 
with these baseline models, we aim to demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of 
our approach.
